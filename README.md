An exercise in Android Studio. Mapping app with the capability of adding custom location with notes and other data.

## v0.1
Removed API key from source and deleted it (thanks Git guardian).
to add your own api key create an .xml file in the /values folder with your API key inside:
```
<resources>
    <item name="API_KEY" type="string"> "** API KEY GOES HERE**" </item>
</resources>
```
